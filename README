This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=481

This script will generate the /// comment blocks for csharp for methods and constructors.  Simply place the cursor anywhere on the first line of the function prototype and hit <c-t>.  It also works on properties, constructors and classes.

Adds summary, remarks, params (for all the params in the function), value (if its a property), and returns (if the function returns something.)

While in comment mode you can tab and shift-tab through the tags, and return and backspace work as they should (enter inserts /// on the new line and backspace erases /// in one bs)

You can get back into comment mode by hitting <c-t> on an existing doc comment.

Questions, comments, concerns, bugs, ideas, etc, drop me an email.
